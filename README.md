# Assembly Joyride
Jetpack Joyride, written in 32-bit x86 assembly.

This project was made mid 2019 as an educational project. 

## How To Play
Run the `joyride.exe`, press SPACE to accelerate upwards and let go do accelerate downwards.

Don't hit the lasers!
Try to survive for as long as possible. The farther you go, the higher your score. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The the more time you stay alive, the faster you go - meaning it will be harder to react to incoming obstacles.

To restart the game after hitting a laser, press the R key.
